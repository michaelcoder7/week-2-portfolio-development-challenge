            <h2>Projects I have created and worked on</h2>
            <p>
                This was my first project which was successfully completed as part of the first week's challenge in our bootcamp. I learned a lot about sementic tags from this project and I enjoyed the process.
                I am always working on improving my skills as a webdesigner.
